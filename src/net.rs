//! Helios-backed verified RPC client with raw-RPC fallback. Per-chain.
//!
//! `NetworkClient` owns one Helios light-client per supported chain
//! (Mainnet via `helios_ethereum::EthereumClient`; Base / Optimism via
//! `helios_opstack::OpStackClient`). Every chain has its own client cache,
//! cooldown clock, and raw-RPC fallback — a Base RPC failure can't affect
//! Mainnet's verified path.
//!
//! When a Helios call errors (sync timeout, build failure, an RPC that
//! won't serve `eth_getProof`, etc.) the per-chain `balance` method falls
//! back to a plain `eth_getBalance` against the same execution RPC. A
//! short cooldown then skips Helios entirely so the user keeps getting
//! balances back without paying the helios attempt cost on every request.
//! After the cooldown elapses, helios is tried again.
//!
//! Mirrors the pattern in kohaku-extension's `HeliosEthersProvider`. The
//! UI reads `last_status(chain)` to surface verification state per-chain.
