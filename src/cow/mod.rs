//! CoW Protocol (CoW Swap) integration — intent-based swapping via the
//! off-chain orderbook.
//!
//! A swap on CoW is an EIP-712-signed *intent* (the [`order::Order`]), not a
//! transaction: the user signs an order off-chain, it's POSTed to CoW's
//! orderbook ([`api`]), and solvers settle it on-chain through the
//! GPv2Settlement contract. Selling an ERC-20 first needs a one-time approval
//! to the [`VAULT_RELAYER`] ([`onchain`]); selling native ETH goes through the
//! [`ethflow`] contract instead (an on-chain `createOrder` with the ETH as
//! `msg.value`).
//!
//! ## Privacy posture
//!
//! Like the rest of Kao, every call here rides the process-wide `ALL_PROXY`
//! tunnel automatically (the shared client in [`crate::indexer::http_client`]).
//! Crucially, **nothing in this module fires until the UI calls it in response
//! to an explicit user action** (a "Get quote" / "Place order" click). There is
//! no background quoting or polling before the user opts in — status polling
//! only starts *after* an order has been deliberately placed.
//!
//! ## Supported networks
//!
//! CoW's orderbook runs on **Mainnet and Base only** — there is no Optimism
//! deployment (`api.cow.fi/optimism` 404s), even though the periphery contracts
//! exist there. [`supported`] / [`api_base`] gate the whole feature.
