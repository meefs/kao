// click-to-copy publishes a no-op message that wakes this screen's update loop
// and starts the bottom-right "Copied!" toast animation (see
// `kao_widgets::CopyKick` — a click changes no app state, so nothing would
// otherwise re-evaluate the toast's tick subscription). The dashboard panes
// return their `AddressCopied` variant (ignored in `update`); the standalone
// Safe-onboarding screen shows no toast and keeps the `None` default.
