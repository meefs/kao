//! Settings → Contacts pane. List, add, edit, delete.
//!
//! The pane never owns a separate contacts list — the canonical state
//! lives in `Arc<RwLock<ContactsBook>>` shared with the App and the rest
//! of the dashboard. Editing builds a `Draft`, and on Save we snapshot
//! the current book, apply the change (upsert at `editing_addr` or
//! append), and bubble a `SaveRequested(Vec<Contact>)` outcome up. The
//! App writes the new vec into the book and dispatches a disk save.
//!
//! Address validation accepts both 0x-hex and ENS-shaped names. ENS
//! contacts are flagged (`Contact::ens`) and re-resolved at send time
//! against their pinned address; a divergence surfaces as a banner the
//! user must explicitly accept before continuing.
