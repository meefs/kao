//! Privacy Pools app — an Apps-tab pane (the `NamesApp` pattern): self-contained
//! UI state that bubbles [`Outcome`]s to the dashboard coordinator, which owns
//! all async I/O (discover/sync/quote/prove/submit) and routes every EOA
//! signature through the shared clear-sign review gate.
//!
//! Views: identity **Setup** (create / restore) → masked **Backup** (reveal on
//! demand) → **Overview** (per-chain pools + pool accounts + anonymity set) →
//! **Deposit** (clear-signed on-chain) → **Withdraw** (relayer or self-relay) →
//! **Review** (fee breakdown) → **Proving** ("Generating the ZK Proof").

// The pane is instantiated + driven by the Apps-tab coordinator wiring, which
// lands next; until that call site exists it reads as dead code. Removed then.
