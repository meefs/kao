//! Safe-transaction primitives — build, hash, sign, pack, and execute
//! a Safe 1.3+ multisig transaction.
//!
//! This module is the layer below the UI. It exposes:
//!
//! - `SafeTxInput` — ergonomic builder input (recipient + value + calldata).
//! - `current_safe_nonce` / `build_safe_tx_with_nonce` — read the Safe's
//!   authoritative on-chain nonce, then assemble a fully-populated
//!   `SafeTx` (relay fields zeroed) at that *pinned* nonce. Split on
//!   purpose: the nonce is read once at review time and carried through
//!   to signing, so the user only ever signs the hash they verified.
//! - `safe_tx_hash` — local EIP-712 signing hash.
//! - `verify_safe_tx_hash_on_chain` / `verify_domain_separator_on_chain` —
//!   cross-checks against the Safe's own `getTransactionHash` /
//!   `domainSeparator` views. Defense-in-depth before signing.
//! - `pack_owner_signatures` — Safe's wire format: 65-byte `r ‖ s ‖ v`
//!   per owner, sorted ascending by signer address, concatenated.
//! - `execute_safe_tx` — ABI-encodes `execTransaction`, builds an
//!   EIP-1559 envelope from the executor EOA, signs it via
//!   `KaoSigner::sign_tx`, and broadcasts.
//!
//! Out of scope (this slice): UI, hardware EIP-712 signing,
//! Safe Transaction Service integration, `contractSignatures`
//! (nested-Safe-as-signer), module txs, DelegateCall, gas-refund
//! parameters, and ERC-20/721 calldata building.
