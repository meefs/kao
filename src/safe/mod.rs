//! Read-only inspection of Gnosis Safe contracts via the `BalanceFetcher`
//! abstraction in [`crate::net`].
//!
//! ## Trust hierarchy
//!
//! For every onboarded Safe we make a binary trust call on the contract
//! behind the proxy:
//!
//! 1. **Canonical** — proxy storage slot 0 holds the address of a Safe
//!    singleton we've audited (entries in `KNOWN_SINGLETONS`). The future
//!    Safe-TX flow will enable signing only on this branch.
//! 2. **UnrecognizedImpl** — singleton is unknown to us but `VERSION()`
//!    returns a string matching the recognized-shape allowlist
//!    (`1.[0-4].\d+`) and the core view methods (`getOwners`,
//!    `getThreshold`) succeed. Surfaced with a visible warning badge;
//!    no signing in v1.
//! 3. **NotASafe / NotDeployed** — rejected outright.
//!
//! The `VERSION()` string is spoofable — anyone can deploy a contract
//! that returns `"1.4.1"` — so the singleton check is the actual trust
//! anchor. The version allowlist is only a secondary gate for the
//! UnrecognizedImpl branch (to filter out contracts that pretend to be
//! Safes but expose totally unrelated ABI shapes).
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! - `inspect_on_chain` does the full read sequence on one chain
//!   (`get_code` → bail if empty; then in parallel:
//!   proxy-slot-0 + VERSION + owners + threshold + nonce + modules +
//!   guard-slot + fallback-handler-slot).
//! - `scan_across_chains` fans `inspect_on_chain` across `Chain::ALL`
//!   in parallel so the onboarding chain chooser can show previews.
//! - `refresh_one` re-reads the cached fields of an existing
//!   `SafeDescriptor` and reports a structured diff. The dashboard
//!   calls this on app-open; the future Safe-TX flow calls it
//!   synchronously before quoting a transaction.
//!
//! Every Safe read in this module funnels through `&dyn BalanceFetcher`
//! so tests can drive the whole path against `CallMock` instead of
//! standing up Helios.
