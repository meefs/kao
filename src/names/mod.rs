//! Unified name-service resolution: dispatches forward (`name → address`) and
//! reverse (`address → name`) lookups across the supported namespaces — ENS
//! (`.eth` and DNS names, [`crate::names::ens`]), GNS (`.gwei`, [`crate::names::gns`]) and
//! WNS (`.wei`, [`crate::names::wns`]).
//!
//! ENS sits behind a registry→resolver indirection. GNS and WNS are
//! *single-contract* namespaces: one `NameNFT` contract is both the registry
//! and the resolver, exposing the ENS-compatible `addr(bytes32)` (forward)
//! alongside a convenience `reverseResolve(address) → string` (reverse). The
//! shared [`NftNameService`] core handles those two; this module routes by TLD.
//!
//! Every read inherits [`crate::names::ens`]'s trust model: it goes through the
//! Helios-verified mainnet path ([`crate::names::ens::verified_call`]) and **fails
//! closed** when the light client can't verify it. A resolved address feeds the
//! signed Send recipient, imported watch-only accounts and Safe owners, so an
//! unverified RPC answer is an error, never a trusted address. Names are
//! normalized (UTS-46 / ENSIP-15) before hashing or display, and reverse
//! results are additionally forward-verified — so neither a hostile RPC nor a
//! namespace owner can fabricate a name on a review surface.
//!
//! Forward dispatch is by TLD suffix; reverse tries ENS first (most
//! established), then GNS, then WNS, returning the first verified match.
